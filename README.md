The point of this yard sign generator: (1) to show a yardsign that elegantly fills the whole screen, for displaying on a tablet that you can hang on the wall or whatever, and (2) to make it easy to click and change the contents of the sign and have the sign reformat itself in real time to make everything fit nicely.
